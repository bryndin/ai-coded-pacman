This is an experiment to implement Pacman using the code generated by public LLMs.

Step 1
######
Prompt: "Using a p5 library generate code for the classic Pacman game. Make sure the code can run."

- MS Copilot generates HTML file with JS code inline that only shows black canvas. Logic there is a no-go hallucination.
- Gemini does generate a reasonable code. But it runs out of tokens and the code is unfinished. Need to find a workaround.

Step 2
######
Prompt: From the code above, only show the Pacman class

- Asked to generate class Pacman separately and now code is syntactically correct.
- The code refers to Ghost class that is not defined anywhere.
- Nothing is being drawn.

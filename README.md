This is an experiment to implement Pacman using the code generated by public LLMs.

## Step 1
*Prompt:* Using a p5 library generate code for the classic Pacman game. Make sure the code can run.

- MS Copilot generates HTML file with JS code inline that only shows black canvas. Logic there is a no-go hallucination.
- Gemini does generate a reasonable code. But it runs out of tokens and the code is unfinished. Need to find a workaround.

## Step 2
*Prompt:* From the code above, only show the Pacman class

- Asked to generate class Pacman separately and now code is syntactically correct.
- The code refers to Ghost class that is not defined anywhere.
- Nothing is being drawn.

## Step 3
*Prompt:* `setup` function refers to `Ghost` that is not defined. Can you create a class for `Ghost`?

- Canvas was empty and the code is clearly missing the `Ghost` class, that we asked Gemeni to generate.
- Adding the newly generated `Ghost` class fixed the code and now we have visuals.
